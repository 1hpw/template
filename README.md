Is this how we will do it?

Projects:
1. Java-based Android alarm clock & calendar & ETC c̄ an "I'm not here" feature & custom widgets & ETC.
1. Java-based Android file manager.
1. C(++)-based game.
1. [Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Android)-based Android app.
1. Linux From Scratch

We could do inline C(++) within a Java wrapper; I think the [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) uses `gcc`, so we could use `cpp` for "portable" inline assembly, defaulting on C(++).
<br>*Oracle either paid Google to use Java in the most inconvenient way possible, or Google employees own shares in Oracle; either way, I'd rather not use Java/JVM/ETC as much as possible...Linux doesn't require every"-thing" to be written/wrapped in C!!*
